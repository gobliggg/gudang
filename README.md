# Gudang: Static File Repository

**Gudang** (warehouse in Sundanese) is a static file repository for storing and organizing your various assets, including:

*   Images (photos, icons, illustrations)
*   Stylesheets (CSS, SCSS)
*   JavaScript files
*   Fonts
*   Media (videos, audio)
*   Data (JSON, XML)

This structure helps you keep your static files organized and easily accessible for your project.

## Directory Structure

Gudang follows a well-defined directory structure to maintain organization:

**images/**: Contains all image assets.

*   **icons/**: For small, symbolic images (e.g., favicons, social media icons).
*   **illustrations/**: For more detailed graphics and drawings (e.g., backgrounds, hero images).
*   **photos/**: For photographs (e.g., product images, team photos).
*   You can add more subfolders as needed (e.g., logos, banners, avatars).

**styles/**: Contains stylesheets.

*   **css/**: For plain CSS files.
    *   **components/**: For CSS specific to individual UI components (e.g., buttons, forms, modals).
*   **scss/**: For SCSS/Sass files (if you're using a CSS preprocessor).

**scripts/**: Contains JavaScript files.

*   **js/**: For JavaScript files.
    *   **modules/**: For modular JavaScript code (e.g., separate files for functionality, utilities).

**fonts/**: Contains font files (e.g., `.ttf`, `.woff`, `.woff2`).

**media/**: Contains other media assets.

*   **videos/**: For video files (e.g., product demos, explainer videos).
*   **audio/**: For audio files (e.g., background music, sound effects).

**data/**: Contains data files (e.g., JSON, XML).

*   **json/**: For JSON data files (e.g., configuration data, API responses).
*   **xml/**: For XML data files (e.g., sitemaps, configuration files).

This is a basic structure, and you can customize it further depending on your project's specific needs.
